This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper null value handling.  The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers, but it lacks robust null checks. The `bug.js` file shows the faulty implementation; `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive null checking in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior and potential errors in applications.
